## Motivation 💭

A DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a new type of organization (or company) that runs leveraging blockchain technology. This enables us to create more transparent, trusted and efficient organisations.

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/cover_2.png" /></p>

**DAOs** are the biggest innovation in the field of governance since the invention of the [LLC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) or perhaps even democracy itself. Just like the **steam engine** made the **Industrial Revolution** possible by harnessing **physical powe**r, DAOs harness **political power** and make a Web3 revolution possible. This could fundamentally change how we organize resources, people and capital with the end goal of creating a more stable, flourishing, collaborative and fair civilisation.

## Mission 🎯

This future is only possible if enough builders stand up to make the dream a reality.

Your goal, if you wish to earn your **Motoko Bootcamp Diploma**, is to build a simple DAO. <br/>

<p align="center"><img src="./assets/diploma_mbc.jpg" style="width: 500px;" /></p>

Based on all the knowledge you've acquired during your training, you should be able to build, from scratch, a simple DAO that follows the necessary requirements.

## Requirements 👨‍🏫

1. **Webpage Control**: The DAO can modify text on a specific webpage. This change is based on proposals approved by DAO members.

2. **Membership and Token Allocation**:

- New members receive 10 Motoko Bootcamp Tokens (MBT) upon joining.
- MBTs are essential for participating in DAO activities.

3. **Role System**:

- The DAO comprises three roles: **Students**, **Graduates**, and **Mentors**.
- **Students**: All new members start as students. They are members who haven't completed the Motoko Bootcamp.
  Graduates: These are members who have completed the Motoko Bootcamp. They gain the right to vote on proposals. Any member can become a Graduate through a `graduate` function, which only a **Mentor** executes. There's no verification process for this.
- **Mentors**: Graduates who are selected by the DAO become **\*Mentors**. They can both vote on and create proposals. An existing Mentor can attempt to assign the Mentor role to any member by creating a proposal that has to be approved by the DAO.

4. **Proposal Creation**

- Only Mentors are authorized to create proposals.
- To create a proposal, a Mentor must burn 1 MBT, which decreases their token balance.

5. **Voting Mechanism**:

- Voting rights are exclusive to Graduates and Mentors.
- The voting power of a member is proportional to their MBT holdings.
- Proposal outcomes are determined by the cumulative MBTs:
  - Passing a Proposal: A proposal is approved if the total MBTs of supporters are 100 or more.
  - Rejecting a Proposal: A proposal is rejected if the total MBTs of opponents are 100 or more.
- There is no MBT cost for voting.

6. **Proposal Execution**:

- Approved proposals are executed automatically.

7. **Initial Setup**:
   The initial setup of the DAO includes the following members to ensure the DAO is operational from the start:

- **Mentor**:
  - Name: **motoko_bootcamp**
  - Associated Principal: `gth2f-eyaaa-aaaaj-qa2pq-cai`.
- **Student 1**:
  - Name: **Motoko**
  - Associated Principal: `4ey3h-nplzm-vyocb-xfjab-wwsos-ejl4y-27juy-qresy-emn7o-eczpl-pae`.
- **Student 2**:
  - Name: **Seb**
  - Associated Principal: `im5mh-xqo25-qfehz-urydn-n7fpm-ylmaw-n6fld-h2xdx-46pcp-tcuti-eqe`.
- **Student 3**:
  - Name: Your name
  - Associated Principal: The principal of the identity used when deploying the canister for the first time, which we call the `owner` of the canister.

> You can decide to hardcode the initial setup or create an external scripts and additional function that will be executed by the `owner` of the canister upon deployment. This is up to you.

8. **Social information** (Optional but recommended if you wish to see your project featured on the Motoko Bootcamp website)

- The DAO exposes public information about it's name, logo, manifesto and social networks. This information is compiled and accessible through the `getStats` function.

```motoko
public type Stats = {
  name : Text; // The name of the DAO;
  logo: Blob; // The logo of the DAO - encoded as a PNG
  picture : Blob; // A picture reprenting the DAO - encoded as a PNG
  numberOfMembers : Nat; // The number of members in the DAO
  manifesto : Text; // The manifesto of the DAO
  socialLinkDAO: Text; // An URL to the DAO's social media page (e.g. Twitter/ OpenChat / Discord / Telegram / DAO's website)
  socialLinkBuilder: Text; // An URL to the DAO's creator social media page (e.g. Twitter/ OpenChat / Personal Blog)
};
```

> The `logo` and `picture` fields are required to be encoded as PNG. The logo should be a square image of 100x100 pixels. The picture should be a 16:9 image of 1920x1080 pixels.

## Token faucet 💰

You are required to use the **Motoko Bootcamp Token**, a free, educational token faucet. It allows unlimited minting but holds no real economic value; it's solely for educational use.

Find the token faucet source code in the [token_faucet](./src/token_faucet/main.mo) folder of this repository. Deploy it locally for building and testing. For deployment on the **Internet Computer** or **Playground**, you are required to use the existing token faucet on the **Internet Computer** with the canister ID `jaamb-mqaaa-aaaaj-qa3ka-cai`.

Access the interface of the deployed token faucet canister [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/jaamb-mqaaa-aaaaj-qa3ka-cai).

You'll need to use the Faucet canister to:

- Mint tokens for the initial setup of the DAO.
- Mint tokens when a new member joins the DAO.
- Burn tokens when a new proposal is created.
- Query the balance of members to determine their voting power. You can use the `balanceOfArray` function of the Faucet canister to query the balance of multiple members at once - avoiding multiple calls to the canister.

## Types ⚙️

All the necessary types are defined in the [types.mo](./src/types.mo) file.

## Interface 📺

The interface of the DAO should be similar to the following:

```motoko
actor {
    getName : shared query () -> async Text;
    getManifesto : shared query () -> async Text;
    registerMember : shared (name : Text) -> async Result<(),Text>;
    getMember : shared query (p : Principal) -> async Result<Member,Text>;
    getStats : shared query () -> async Stats;
    graduate : shared (student : Principal) -> async Result<(),Text>;
    createProposal : shared (content : ProposalContent) -> async Result<ProposalId,Text>;
    getProposal : shared query (id : ProposalId) -> async Result<Proposal,Text>;
    getAllProposals : shared query () -> async [Proposal];
    voteProposal : shared (proposalId : ProposalId, vote : Vote) -> async Result<(),Text>;
    http_request : shared query (request : HttpRequest) -> async HttpResponse;
}
```

## How to submit your project 📬

Head over to the [Motoko Bootcamp Dashboard](https://www.motokobootcamp.com/), section **Submit**, **Graduation** and input your canister ID.

## Benefits of Graduation 🎓

Your Motoko Bootcamp diploma will grant you the following lifetime benefits:

- Access to a dedicated Motoko Bootcamp Graduate Channel on **OpenChat**.
- Access to a dedicated Motoko Bootcamp Portal on **DSCVR**.
- Access to the **Motoko Bootcamp Manifesto**.
- Possible participation in future **Bootcamps**.
- Additional benefits to be announced.

> **The Motoko Bootcamp Diploma and the associated on-chain infrastructure are still under development. We will keep you updated on the progress.**
